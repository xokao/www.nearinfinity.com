  <h2>COMPANY HISTORY</h2>
  <p><em>NEAR INFINITY</em> was founded in 2002 by Reston native, Chris D'Agostino. Chris served as Chief Executive Officer for over nine years before transitioning into his current role of Chief Technology Officer. As CTO, Chris is focused on running the company’s products division and providing overall technical direction for the business. 

  <p>When he founded the company, D’Agostino was motivated by a need he saw within the government to modernize software development practices, specifically bringing agile methodologies, code sharing, and open source software into the Community. He and the early Near Infinity developers started government-based discussion forums, teamed with like-minded contractors, initiated a series of on-site training events, and brought in technical experts from the commercial world to teach and discuss new ideas.  They pushed to expand the development tools available on the approved products list, and introduced technologies on many of the Community’s flagship applications that allowed for faster development time and higher success rates for delivery. 

  <p>Today, with cyber warfare at the forefront of the Community's mission challenges, the need for modern software development technologies, tools, frameworks, and methodologies is greater than ever, and Near Infinity is perfectly positioned to respond.
