  <p>The internal NIC-U training program is one of Near Infinity's most effective and popular benefits. It includes a training/ conference budget, book budget, in-house training, and bi-annual technical conferences.
  <section class="headers">
  <h2>Conference / Training budget</h2>
  <p>The NIC-U program includes an employee self-managed training budget of $5,000 and 8 days for software development training. We encourage our developers to "cross-train" in technologies they don't use every day in order to expand our corporate resume and maintain a wide range of skills.

  <h2>In-house training and tech days</h2>
  <p>The in-house portion of our training program includes free monthly tech sessions and a free bi-annual tech day for all employees. In addition, when a new technology is of interest to a large number of NIC developers, we bring top instructors to our site for custom training courses.

  <h2>Book budget</h2> 
  <p>The NIC-U program also includes a $500 per-employee book and software allowance, which developers use for digital or hard-copy books or publications, IDEs, and other development tools.
