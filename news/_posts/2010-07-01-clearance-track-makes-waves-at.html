<p>Near Infinity's clearance management software, Clearance Track, is being exhibited at the <a href="http://www.ncsi.com/dsss10/index.shtml" target="_blank">DSSS Conference</a> in San Antonio this week for an audience of government and industry security officers. The software helps security officers automate, organize and speed up the processes surrounding personnel clearances, complementing the DSSS focus on cyber threats by securely storing sensitive clearance-related data. Many visitors to the Clearance Track booth commented on their need for an alternative to their outdated Excel spreadsheets or Access databases and their excitement about Clearance Track's ability to fill that need.</p>
