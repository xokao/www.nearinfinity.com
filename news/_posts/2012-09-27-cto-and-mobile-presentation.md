Near Infinity CTO, Chris D'Agostino, and senior software engineer,
Jason Harwig recently spoke to a group of computer science students
and mobile development club members at Virginia Tech. Their lecture
focused on mobile and iOS security, specifically discussing ways that
secure applications can leverage built-in sensors, including GPS, the
accelerometer, and the camera for facial detection, recognition and
computer vision. The presentation was part of Near Infinity's ongoing
efforts to connect with students and the technical community through
teaching classes, hosting user group meet-ups, and speaking at local
conferences and events.
