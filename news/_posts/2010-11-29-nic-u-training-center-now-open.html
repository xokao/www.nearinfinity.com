<p>Near Infinity recently expanded its space to include a high-tech learning facility called the NIC-U Training Center. Located across the hall from our Campus Commons office, the Training center features high-speed wireless internet access, power outlets for each attendee, an advanced sound and video system, and a modern cafe for snacks, meals, and relaxing. The space is available for daily and hourly rentals and seats up to 70 people. <a href="/news/assets/NIC-U_Training_Center.pdf">View details of the new training space</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRBX_TXdFU" target="_blank">watch the video tour of the space</a>.</p>
