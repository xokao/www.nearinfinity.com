RESTON, VIRGINIA

Near Infinity is pleased to announce that it has raised $17 million in equity capital
from Columbia Capital and Razor’s Edge Ventures. The funds will be used to
accelerate organic growth and pursue acquisition opportunities. In conjunction
with the financing, Near Infinity welcomes Dr. Richard A. Upton as President. Dr.
Upton has extensive experience driving growth of high technology firms having held
executive leadership positions at BBN Technologies, ALPHATECH Inc., and TASC.

Near Infinity is a leader in software development for the federal market specifically
in the fields of cloud and big data analytics, mobile security and trusted applications.
Founded in 2002 by Reston-native Chris D'Agostino, the company focuses on solving
key Intelligence Community mission challenges.

“Near Infinity has a lot of momentum right now, ” said founder and CTO Chris
D’Agostino. “We’ve been profitable with strong growth for years, but with the
financial backing and industry relationships now available to us through Columbia
Capital and Razor’s Edge and the addition of Ric Upton, we can scale more
aggressively, especially around mobile and big data products and services.”

In his new role at Near Infinity, Dr. Upton will be focused on growing the business
and expanding into new customer spaces within the U.S. Intelligence and Defense
communities. “With Columbia’s mobile expertise, Razor’s extensive knowledge
of the national security market, and our deep pool of talented engineers and
differentiated products/services, Near Infinity is a force to be reckoned with,” said
Upton. “This is an exciting time to be joining the team. “

Arun Gupta, Partner at Columbia Capital, emphasized the partnership aspect of
the investment moving forward. “We believe that Near Infinity is well-positioned
in what we believe will be an explosive market for products and services at the
intersection of mobile, big data, and cyber. It is very impressive what the company
has accomplished to date and we are excited to work with them to accelerate scaling
the business.”

Mark Spoto, Managing Director of Razor's Edge Ventures, agrees. “We are confident
that Near Infinity’s unique expertise will be needed by an expanding set of
customers, and we look forward to helping them accelerate their diversification into
new markets and customers."

As the company grows, the management team will focus on maintaining aspects
of the company that have made it unique. “One of the best aspects about this
investment is that NIC has an opportunity to grow without disrupting our culture,”
said D’Agostino. “The things that NIC employees love -- our benefits, our passion 
for technology, our focus on people -- these are the things that have allowed us to
attract and keep the area’s best developers. We are making sure they stay intact
moving forward.”
