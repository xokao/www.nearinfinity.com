Teams of Near Infinity engineers and recruiters recently returned from our annual college road trip. This year, we attended career fairs at three area universities, Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, and Penn State University, where we talked to hundreds of students and interviewed nearly 50 for internships and full-time employment. Students from the three schools have been invited to Near Infinity for our bi-annual NIC-U conference, which will include for the first time an Arduino Hack Night.
