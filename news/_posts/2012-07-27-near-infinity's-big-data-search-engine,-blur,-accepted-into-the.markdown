Near Infinity is pleased to announce that its big data search engine, Blur, has been accepted into the Apache Incubator program, the entryway to becoming a fully-fledged open source project in the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). ASF includes a number of big data applications and technologies related to Blur, including Hadoop, Lucene, Thrift and Zookeeper.

Blur was originated by Aaron McCurry, Near Infinity’s Technical Director for Data Solutions, in 2010 to solve the challenges of dealing with searching huge quantities of data. Initial committers also include Near Infinity big data engineers, Scott Leberknight and Ryan Gimmy, as well as Apache’s Tim Williams, Patrick Hunt and Doug
Cutting.

Blur is an open source search platform capable of querying massive amounts of data at incredible speeds. Rather than using the flat, document-like data model used by most search solutions, Blur allows
developers to build rich data models and search them in a semi-relational manner similar to joins while querying a relational database.

With Blur, users can get precise search results against terabytes of data at Google-like speeds. Blur leverages multiple open source projects including Hadoop, Lucene, Thrift and ZooKeeper to create an environment where structured data can be transformed into an index that runs on a Hadoop cluster. For example, Blur uses the power of Map/Reduce for bulk indexing into Blur. Server failures are handled automatically by using ZooKeeper for cluster state and HDFS for index storage.

Established in 2002, the Apache Incubator program serves as temporary container for projects that wish to become part of the foundation’s efforts.
