<p>Near Infinity this year adopted 56 children and teenagers through Reston Interfaith's Adopt-a-Family Gift Drive, which provides personalized holiday gifts to Reston-area families in need. The donation made Near Infinity the organization's largest donor for 2009.</p>

<p>Near Infinity has participated in the Adopt-a-Family program since 2007, sponsoring a total of 96 children, and matching employee donations by 100 percent.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the overwhelming response from our community, all of the children who signed up to receive holiday gifts have been adopted," said Reston Interfaith.</p>
