Near Infinity developer, Aaron McCurry was praised this week for his contributions to Cloudera Search in a blog post by Doug Cutting, Clouderaâ€™s chief architect, a founder of the Apache Lucene and Apache Hadoop projects, and the current chair of the Apache Software Foundation.

In the article, Cutting credits McCurry and his open source project, Apache Blur ([http://incubator.apache.org/projects/blur.html](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/blur.html)) for inspiring the HDFS/Solr index integration within Cloudera's search, a new open source search project that uses Lucene to allow non-technical users to interactively explore and analyze data in Hadoop.

Apache Blur is a search engine capable of querying massive amounts of data at incredible speeds. It combines the speed of document-oriented databases with the ability to build rich data models to deliver lightening-fast answers to complex queries.
