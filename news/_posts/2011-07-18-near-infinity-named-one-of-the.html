<p><br />Near Infinity Corporation was named one of this year's 50 Best Small and Medium Companies to Work For by the Great Place to Work Institute, published by entrepreneur.com, which underscores employee trust in the workplace. Near Infinity was recognized in particular for its outstanding in-house training program and employee-managed software and training budgets.</p> 
<p>Near Infinity was chosen as a 2010 winner by participating in the Great Place to Work Institute's selection process, which includes a Trust IndexÂ© Employee Survey, a questionnaire filled out by NIC employees about programs and company practices, and an in-depth culture audit. The Great Place to Work Institute evaluated the company based on five areas: credibility, respect, fairness, pride and camaraderie. The Institute's unique methodology measures the level of trust that exists between employees and management, the pride employees express about the company and the camaraderie employees share.</p>

<p>Other 2010 winners include Shutterfly, Radio Flyer, and Near Infinity's partner, Atlassian. <a href="http://www.greatplacetowork.com/what_we_do/lists-us-sme.htm" target="_blank">See the full list of 2010 winners</a>. </p>
