Two teams of developers from Near Infinity participated in the 2012
Node.js Knockout, a two-day node.js hackathon held November 11-12. The
NIC teams spent 48 hours eating, sleeping and coding at the NIC
Training Facility in Reston, Virginia, developing two open source Node
projects, [GitHood](http://nic-team.nko3.jitsu.com/#) and [RoboNode](http://nic.nko3.jitsu.com/).

Githood makes sharing git repositories on your local network easy. It
allows you to configure which repositories you want to share, and
other Githood users on your network can automatically discover and
clone/pull them over the embedded Git HTTP server.

RoboNode is a robot battle system written in Node. Players write
scripts to control their robots and lead them into battle. Code can be
changed on the fly, and experimentation is encouraged.

Judging and voting on the 166 competition entries is open this week,
with winners being announced on November 19.
