<p>Near Infinity this year adopted 88 children through Reston Interfaith's Gifts For Kids drive, a program which helps neighbors in need by providing children with personalized holiday gifts. This is the fourth year Near Infinity has participated in the program, bringing the total number of kids who have been adopted by NIC to 184. The company's employees select children from a list showing their age and three wishes, and for each child adopted, the company matches by adopting an additional child.</p>

<p>This year's drive was an overwhelming success for Reston Interfaith, with all 1,520 children being paired with donors.</p>
