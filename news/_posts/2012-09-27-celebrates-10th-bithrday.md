Near Infinity this month celebrated 10 years of building great
software. Founded in Reston, Virginia in 2002 by Chris D'Agostino,
Near Infinity has grown to 75 people while maintaining a sharp focus
on solving mission-critical problems in the U.S. Intelligence
Community. The company celebrated with an event in Washington DC,
which included a GPS-based scavenger hunt for employees and a
night-time party at the Gaylord Hotel at National Harbor.
