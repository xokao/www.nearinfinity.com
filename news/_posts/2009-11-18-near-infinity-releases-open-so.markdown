On November 14th, Near Infinity open-sourced Grant, a Ruby on Rails plugin for securing and auditing access to your Rails model objects. Grant is actively used and developed on one of Near Infinity's major projects to ensure we don't forget to enforce security constraints throughout the application.

Are you sure you haven't inadvertently forgotten to secure something in your application? Check out [Grant](http://github.com/nearinfinity/grant) and put your mind at ease.
