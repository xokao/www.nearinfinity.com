Near Infinity for the fourth time sponsored Run! Geek! Run!, a charity 8K event in Washington, D.C. this September. The race raised money for the Equal Footing Foundation, an organization that helps put technology into the hands of under-served youth. In addition to being sponsors, NIC also fielded a team of 24 runners.
