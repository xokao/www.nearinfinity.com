    <h2> Near Infinity has developed a set of tools called Springboard, which we use to start up new applications in Java and Ruby on Rails. The components of Springboard cut weeks or even months of development time off project start-up times, maximizing custom development time and ensuring consistency and security for all Near Infinity applications. Springboard includes the following components</h2>
    <ul class="triangles">
      <li>Proof - Authentication of users by looking up the client certificates in an LDAP directory</li>
      <li>Auditor [link]- Model event-based hooks for capturing detailed audit information about any create, update or delete</li>
      <li>Grant [link] - Model event-based hooks for white listing what can be done to the data.</li>
      <li>Admin - An administrative interface that provides all of the other components a place to put admin data.</li>
      <li>Error - Traps all errors in the application and logs the details in the database and sends them to system administrators.</li>
      <li>ExtJS and ExtJS Extensions - Provides the ExtJS library files and custom configurations and components.</li>
      <li>LDAP - Provides easy methods for looking up user and group information in LDAP.</li>
      <li>Logger - Provides custom log formatting that will include the current user's information with the log statement.</li>
      <li>User - Provides the entire application with easy access to the current user information without the need to pass info between all of the layers.</li>
      <li>Template - a base application that is pre-wired with all of the above and the most recent version of Rails</li>
