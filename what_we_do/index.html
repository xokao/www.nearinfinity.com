  <h1>What We Do</h1>
</hgroup>

<p>Near Infinity serves a wide range of customers in the federal government. We’ve made significant contributions to several key mission priorities, including identity intelligence, big data search, mobile phone vulnerability research, and improving the efficiency of clearance processing. 

<p>One of our current areas of focus is big data identity intelligence. This emerging field involves ingesting, mining, searching, analyzing, and relating massive amounts of data from many sources, allowing analysts to form more complete views of specific individuals. It allows analysts to correlate various aspects of a person, including actions and risk factors to create a 360 degree view of the individual.  

<p>One Near Infinity initiative in particular, the open source search engine Blur (www.blur.io), has played a key role in moving the government community forward with identity intelligence.

<p>Near Infinity is intensely focused on the emerging fields of mobile and big data technology, and we have taken a proactive approach to meeting anticipated technology demands, learning and using both mobile and big data technologies well ahead of the curve.

<h2>MOBILE</h2>
<p>Near Infinity's involvement in mobile development started in 2007, with a handful of software engineers learning iPhone development before the App Store had even launched. Since then, half of Near Infinity’s engineers have become fluent in iOS and/or Android development, and we are respected as mobile experts, having presented at conferences across the country and taught university-level courses in mobile development.

<h2>BIG DATA</h2>
<p>The same is true of our history with big data. In 2008 we kicked off our first big data project, long before big data buzzwords became commonplace. We saw the potential in the technology, and we’ve focused our attention and training dollars on learning the hardware and software associated with big data, cloud computing and related technologies. Today, Near Infinity has the equivalent of 32 man years of experience developing, deploying, operating and evolving the government contracting community’s most successful cloud-based, big data entity analytic capabilities.
