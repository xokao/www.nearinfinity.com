<section class='about'>
<p>Near Infinity serves a wide range of customers in the federal government. Weâ€™ve made significant contributions to several key mission priorities, including identity intelligence, big data search, mobile phone vulnerability research, and improving the efficiency of clearance processing. 

<p>One of our current areas of focus is big data identity intelligence. This emerging field involves ingesting, mining, searching, analyzing, and relating massive amounts of data from many sources, allowing analysts to form more complete views of specific individuals. It allows analysts to correlate various aspects of a person, including actions and risk factors to create a 360 degree view of the individual.  

<p>One Near Infinity initiative in particular, the open source search engine <a href='www.blur.io'/>Blur</a>, has played a key role in moving the government community forward with identity intelligence.
