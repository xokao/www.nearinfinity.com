  <p> In 2008 we kicked off our first big data project, long before big data buzzwords became commonplace We saw the potential in the technology, and we’ve focused our attention and training dollars on learning the hardware and software associated with big data, cloud computing and related technologies. Today, Near Infinity has the equivalent of 32 man years of experience developing, deploying, operating and evolving the government contracting community’s most successful cloud-based, big data entity analytic capabilities.
