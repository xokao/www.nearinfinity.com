<p>Since ruby is such a dynamic language, how much can we tell about it statically? Can we get hints about parts of our design that need improving? We can, and reek is a great tool for this. Reek bills itself as the code smell detector for Ruby! We'll talk about its features, gotchas, future, and even its internals.</p>
