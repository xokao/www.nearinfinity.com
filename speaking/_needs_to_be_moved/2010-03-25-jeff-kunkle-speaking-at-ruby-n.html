<p>Does Git seem like a pinch of familiar version control concepts combined with a whole lot of black magic? If you're new to distributed version control systems the thought of how Git pulls off it's incredible speed and effortless branching can be intimidating. However, if you pull back the covers long enough to understand what's going on inside, you'll find there's nothing to fear.</p>

<p>This talk looks at the fundamental concepts of Git, exposing its brilliant simplicity with descriptions of the various object types, references, and branches. This talk isn't going to cover the laundry list of Git commands, but it should leave you feeling surprisingly confident about using Git.</p>{% endraw %}
