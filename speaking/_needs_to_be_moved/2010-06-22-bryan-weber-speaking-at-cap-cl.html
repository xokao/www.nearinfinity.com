<p><strong>Calling Clojure from Java</strong></p>

<p>From Bryan: "I could do a presentation (and live coding session) on calling Clojure from Java. We all know it works well in the other direction, but let's explore what calling a Clojure library from Java looks like!"</p>

<p>Don't forget to bring your laptop for some live coding.</p>{% endraw %}
