<p>This talk is not only for Ninjas! One of the most frequently cited benefits of Clojure is being able to take advantage of the Java libraries and ecosystem. This talk will cover calling Java from Clojure and just as importantly calling Clojure from Java. Any ninjas that attend will come out of the session knowing how to use Clojure on a Java project without being detected... well, almost anyway.</p>
