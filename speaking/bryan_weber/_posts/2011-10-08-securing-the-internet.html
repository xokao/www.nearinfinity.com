<p>The internet is constantly changing, but lately there have been significant updates with new and more secure protocols. We'll discuss the status of IPv4 and what is being done in an attempt to make the internet a safer place. This talk will cover changes to WHOIS, routing infrastructure and the introduction of DNSSEC and IPv6.</p>
