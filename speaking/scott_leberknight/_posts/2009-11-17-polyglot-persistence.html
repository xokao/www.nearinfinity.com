<p>Polyglot persistence is all about considering your persistence requirements and selecting a persistence mechanism that best mets those requirements, as opposed to selecting an RDBMS as the default choice. In this session we'll look at some of the persistence alternatives that are available like Amazon SimpleDB, CouchDB, Google Bigtable, and more. In late 2006 Neal Ford wrote about Polyglot Programming and predicted the wave of language choice we are now seeing in the industry to use the right language for the specific job at hand. Instead of assuming a "default" language like Java or C# and then warring over the many different available frameworks, polyglot programming is all about using the right language for the job rather than just the right framework(s). Paralleling Neal's description of polyglot programming, a relational database is often the accepted and default choice for persistence. Sometimes this is due to the fact that organizations have standardized on RDBMS systems and there isn't even any other choice. Other times it is simply what we're used to doing, and possibly we don't even consider alternatives. But now, with things like Amazon SimpleDB, Google Bigtable, Microsoft SQL Server Data Services (SSDS), CouchDB, and lots more, we're now seeing the beginning of Polyglot Persistence in addition to polyglot programming.</p>
