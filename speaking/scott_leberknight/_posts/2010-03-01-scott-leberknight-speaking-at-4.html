The Spring framework has simplified Java enterprise and web development since 2003, and has been a major innovator in improving and simplifying Java server-side programming since its inception. This session will look at the new features in Spring 3.0.</p><p>

</p><p>Spring 3.0 refactored much of the Spring core so it will no longer run on Java 1.4 and earlier, meaning it is optimized for Java 5 and beyond. Spring 3.0 includes several notable new features like the expression language (EL), support for REST, Spring MVC improvements including @PathParam and URI templates, and much more. In addition, Spring 3.0 will deprecate and remove from the Spring core several APIs like the original Spring MVC controller hierarchy and JUnit 3.8 support. There is also new support to make scheduling jobs cleaner and easier.</p>{% endraw %}
