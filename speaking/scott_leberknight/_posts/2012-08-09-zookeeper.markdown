Apache ZooKeeper is an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination. Because coordinating distributed systems is a Zoo!

ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization and group services. ZooKeeper aims at distilling the essence of these different services into a very simple interface to a centralized, distributed, and highly reliable coordination service.

ZooKeeper is used in many open source projects including HBase, Neo4J, Blur and Solr.

In this talk we'll cover the basics of ZooKeeper, how it works, and see several practical examples.
