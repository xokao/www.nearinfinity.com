<strong>Introduction to CoffeeScript&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1591593499/eorg" target="_blank">Â»more</a>

<p>CoffeeScript is a new language that embodies the the essentials of JavaScript without the verbosity. It compiles directly to JavaScript which means it runs in any JavaScript environment like your favorite web browser or Node.js. Recently Ruby on Rails announced direct support for CoffeeScript in version 3.1, and CoffeeScript seems to be gaining more popularity every day. This talk introduces CoffeeScript's syntax, idioms, scoping and context rules, and how it directly supports class-based OO (which you might or might not think is a good thing), as well other cool features.</p>{% endraw %}
