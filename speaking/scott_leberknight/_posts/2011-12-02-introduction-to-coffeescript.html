<p>CoffeeScript is a language that combines Ruby-ish and Python-esque flavors, and compiles directly to JavaScript. CoffeeScript's golden rule is "It's just JavaScript" so you can always see exactly what JavaScript is generated by the CoffeeScript compiler. In fact it will probably make you a better JavaSscript developer! It combines the best of JavaScript and its power in a clear, concise syntax that is easy to learn and use. You can also use it in your existing web applications with any JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, Prototype, and Scriptaculous. This session will present an overview of CoffeeScript and its features.</p>
