<p>Lucene is a fast, scalable full text search engine used in many applications and open source projects and it has become the standard for embedded searching for Java applications.</p>
<p>Out of the box Lucene is very good at indexing, storing, and retrieving unstructured data.  We will discuss techniques and lessons learned from using Lucene to be the primary data store for structured data that horizontality scales to billions of records.</p>
