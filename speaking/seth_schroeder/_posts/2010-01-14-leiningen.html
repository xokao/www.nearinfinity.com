<p><a href="http://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a> is an exciting, new dynamic programming language for the Java Virtual Machine. A vibrant community has sprung up around Clojure and started to produce infrastructure.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/tree/stable" target="_blank">Leiningen</a> is a Clojure-friendly build tool initiated and led by <a href="http://technomancy.us/colophon" target="_blank">Phil Hagelberg</a>. It provides a way to create skeleton applications, and eagerly supports fleshing them out with any dependency Maven can track. Testing and packaging code is supported out of the box. Let Leiningen handle project-common tasks so you can focus on what your project specifically needs!</p>
