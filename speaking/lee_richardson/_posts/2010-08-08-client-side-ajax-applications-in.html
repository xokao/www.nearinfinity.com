<p>Building modern looking applications in SharePoint has historically involved either using slow and buggy AJAX control toolkit controls or writing large amounts of plumbing code to expose and ultimately consume SharePoint list data with client-side JavaScript.  SharePoint 2010 solves the problem of data accessibility by exposing all SharePoint data in REST and JSON formats via WCF Data Services (aka ADO.Net Data Services, aka Astoria, aka oData).  ASP.Net AJAX 4.0 Templates simplify consuming this data for building responsive, 100% client based AJAX applications with significantly less yet more maintainable code.  This 100% demo based presentation will explore how to use these two new technologies to write modern looking and responsive applications in a SharePoint 2010 environment.</p>
