In the not too distant future, your smartphone may very well be your primary form of identification and authentication for everything ranging from financial transactions, voting and international travel. In order to properly determine your identity, multiple factors need to be used to authenticate you to a given application.

During this presentation, we will talk about developing secure applications that leverage the built-in sensors of the device including the camera for facial detection, recognition and computer vision. Other sensors will be discussed including GPS and the accelerometer.

We will also provide a brief overview of iOS development and what steps you need to take to incorporate third-party frameworks and libraries into your application.
