<p>Writing an HTML5 canvas application can open up many different ways to present information on the internet than was previously available in browsers natively.  Through experimenting with canvas, I was able to come up with 5 strategies to create canvas applications that worked sufficiently well in the common browsers and in resource constrained environments.  The strategies include simple things such as only coding for your target audience and only animating what needs to be animated, but also ways to measure heuristics and optimize your animation loop to be as tight as possible.  Though none of the strategies are sure-fire methods for writing a great application, they can be applied in thoughtful ways to increase performance and lighten the processing load in almost any canvas HTML5 canvas application.
