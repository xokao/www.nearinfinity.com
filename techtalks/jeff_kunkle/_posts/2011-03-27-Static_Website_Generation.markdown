Jeff Kunkle presents on Static Website Generation.

With all the tools available today for publishing a website or blog,it's easy to discount the traditional static website. However, you should think twice before drawing that conclusion. Static websites are super-fast, easy to implement, and can be hosted with almost any provider. This short presentation touches on static website generation using nanoc, a static website generation tool written in Ruby. While you won't be a nanoc expert after watching the video, it should give you an idea of how easy it is to quickly get up and running with astatic site.
