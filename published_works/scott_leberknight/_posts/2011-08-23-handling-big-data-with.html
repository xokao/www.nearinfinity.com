<p>In the past few years we have seen a veritable explosion in various ways to store and retrieve data. The so-called NoSql databases have been leading the charge and creating all these new persistence choices. These alternatives have, in large part, become more popular due to the rise of Big Data led by companies such as Google, Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook as they have amassed vast amounts of data that must be stored, queried, and analyzed. But more and more companies are collecting massive amounts of data and they need to be able to effectively use all that data to fuel their business. For example social networks all need to be able to analyze large social graphs of people and make recommendations for who to link to next, while almost every large website out there now has a recommendation engine that tries to suggest ever more things you might want to purchase. As these businesses collect more data, they need a way to be able to easily scale-up without needing to re-write entire systems.</p>
