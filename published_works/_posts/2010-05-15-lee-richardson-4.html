<p>In parts <a href="http://www.endusersharepoint.com/EUSP2010/2010/04/23/client-side-ajax-applications-in-sharepoint-2010-%e2%80%93-part-1-introduction/" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="http://www.endusersharepoint.com/EUSP2010/2010/04/29/client-side-ajax-applications-in-sharepoint-2010-%e2%80%93-part-2-wcf-data-services/" target="_blank">two</a> of this series I described how WCF Data Services in SharePoint 2010 exposes list data as both XML and JSON.  In part <a href="http://www.endusersharepoint.com/EUSP2010/2010/05/12/client-side-ajax-applications-in-sharepoint-2010-%e2%80%93-part-3-asp-net-ajax-templating-101/" target="_blank">three</a>, I showed how to set up ASP.Net AJAX Templating and how to write a simple application that displays a list of user story list items.</p>

<p>In this part of the series I'll show how to integrate with jQuery to display the user stories as draggable index cards on a virtual cork board and how to persist the X and Y coordinates back to SharePoint.</p>{% endraw %}
