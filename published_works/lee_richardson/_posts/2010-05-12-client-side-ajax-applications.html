<p>As I've described in Part One and particularly Part Two of this series, WCF Data Services is an extremely compelling element of SharePoint 2010.  However, as powerful as it is, programming against it directly would still be somewhat painful.  Fortunately, a new related technology - ASP.Net AJAX Templating - integrates beautifully with WCF Data Services and allows for quickly building pretty, maintainable and responsive AJAX applications.</p>

<p>In this part in the series I'll describe ASP.Net AJAX Templating, give a tutorial of building a simple application page in Visual Studio 2010, and then build out a very simple page using ASP.Net AJAX Templating that displays SharePoint 2010 list data exposed as JSON by WCF Data Services.</p>
