<p>In previous articles I have written on Flex Development, I have stated that one of the good things about developing applications in Flex is how close to Java development it feels. Not to say that Java is the only language in which to develop, but if you work in a language/platform day in and day out to pay the bills, working with something new that is similar to a language/platform that you already know is a plus in my book. Specifically you will learn:</p>
<ul><li>The Interface construct in ActionScript 3.0 and how it is functionally equivalent to Java interfaces.</li>
	<li>How to use Interfaces in ActionScript 3.0 to achieve dependency injection.</li>
	<li>How to use a simple form of dependency injection within Flex.</li>
</ul>
