Network volatility, HTTP server errors, service outages—all require custom fault handling code, whose effective implementation requires considerable programming expertise and effort. To provide a systematic and principled approach to handling faults in RESTful applications, we present FT-REST—an architectural framework for specifying fault tolerance functionality declaratively and then translating these speciﬁcations into platform-speciﬁc code. FT-REST encapsulates fault tolerance strategies in XML-based speciﬁcations and compiles them to modules that reify the requisite fault tolerance. To validate our approach, we have applied FT-REST to enhance several realistic RESTful applications to withstand the faults described in their FT-REST speciﬁcations. As REST is said to apply verbs (HTTP commands) to nouns (URIs), FT-REST enhances this conceptual model with adverbs that render REST reliable via reusable and extensible fault tolerance.\n","path":"/speaking/john_edstrom/2012/06/25/reusable-and-extensible-fault-tolerance-for-restful-applications.html.html","filename":"2012-06-25-reusable-and-extensible-fault-tolerance-for-restful-applications.markdown"}],"lrichard":[{"layout":"speaking","title":"Client Side AJAX Applications in SharePoint 2010","date":"2010-08-08","location":"Reston, Virginia","talk_url":"http://www.sugdc.org/Events/Meetings/tabid/57/Default.aspx","user_group":{"name":"SUGDC","url":"http://www.sugdc.org/"},"body":"<p>Building modern looking applications in SharePoint has historically involved either using slow and buggy AJAX control toolkit controls or writing large amounts of plumbing code to expose and ultimately consume SharePoint list data with client-side JavaScript.

In this session we'll look at some of the persistence alternatives that are available like Amazon SimpleDB, CouchDB, Google Bigtable, and more. In late 2006 Neal Ford wrote about Polyglot Programming and predicted the wave of language choice we are now seeing in the industry to use the right language for the specific job at hand. Instead of assuming a \"default\" language like Java or C# and then warring over the many different available frameworks, polyglot programming is all about using the right language for the job rather than just the right framework(s). Paralleling Neal's description of polyglot programming, a relational database is often the accepted and default choice for persistence. Sometimes this is due to the fact that organizations have standardized on RDBMS systems and there isn't even any other choice. Other times it is simply what we're used to doing, and possibly we don't even consider alternatives. But now, with things like Amazon SimpleDB, Google Bigtable, Microsoft SQL Server Data Services (SSDS), CouchDB, and lots more, we're now seeing the beginning of Polyglot Persistence in addition to polyglot programming.</p>","path":"/speaking/scott_leberknight/2009/11/17/polyglot-persistence.html.html","filename":"2009-11-17-polyglot-persistence.html"},{"layout":"speaking","title":"Speaking at NFJS","date":"2009-11-20","location":"Denver, Colorado","talk_url":null,"conference":{"name":"No Fluff Just Stuff Symposium Tour","url":"http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/"},"body":"<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; \"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Check out the session schedules for more info.</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; \"><strong>Introduction to Hibernate</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/speaker/scott_leberknight.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; \">»more</a></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; \">This session introduces the Hibernate Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, showing the basics of persisting Java objects to relational databases.

HDFS is a distributed filesystem which efficiently stores very large files across a cluster in a fault-tolerant manner. MapReduce is a framework for dividing data processing into two distinct phases, mapping and reducing, in order to deconstruct a problem so it can be run in parallel across many machines in order to speed data transformation and aggregation. In this talk we'll look at both HDFS and the MapReduce framework.
