        <h2>System Metrics</h2>
        <p>System Metrics is a Rails 3 Engine providing a clean web interface to performance metrics instrumented with ActiveSupport::Notifications. It will collect and display the notifications baked into Rails and any additional custom ones you add using ActiveSupport::Notification#instrument.</p>
        <p>System Metrics is not intended to be a replacement for performance monitoring solutions such as New Relic. However, it is especially handy for quickly identifying performance problems in a development environment. It's also a great alternative for private networks disconnected from the Internet.</p>

        <h2>Blur</h2>
        <p>Blur is an open source search engine capable of querying massive amounts of structured data at incredible speeds. Rather than using the flat, document-like data model used by most search solutions, Blur allows you to build rich data models and search them in a relational manner similar to querying a relational database. Using Blur you can get precise search results against terabytes or petabytes of data at Google-like speeds.</p>
        <p>Working hand-in-hand with Hadoop, Blur also also gives you the ability to correlate structured data in complex and meaningful ways. Here's an example of the kind of query you could perform with Blur using data from the US Census: show me all of the people in the United States who were born in Alaska between 1940 and 1970 who are now living in Kansas.</p>
