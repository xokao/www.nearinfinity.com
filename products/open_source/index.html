    <h2>System Metrics</h2>
    <p>System Metrics is a Rails 3 Engine providing a clean web interface to performance metrics instrumented with ActiveSupport::Notifications. It will collect and display the notifications baked into Rails and any additional custom ones you add using ActiveSupport::Notification#instrument.</p>

    <p>System Metrics is not intended to be a replacement for performance monitoring solutions such as New Relic. However, it is especially handy for quickly identifying performance problems in a development environment. It's also a great alternative for private networks disconnected from the Internet. <a href="http://nearinfinity.github.com/system-metrics/">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>Blur</h2>
    <p>Blur is an open source search engine capable of querying massive amounts of structured data at incredible speeds. Rather than using the flat, document-like data model used by most search solutions, Blur allows you to build rich data models and search them in a relational manner similar to querying a relational database. Using Blur you can get precise search results against terabytes or petabytes of data at Google-like speeds.</p>

    <p>Working hand-in-hand with Hadoop, Blur also also gives you the ability to correlate structured data in complex and meaningful ways. Here's an example of the kind of query you could perform with Blur using data from the US Census: show me all of the people in the United States who were born in Alaska between 1940 and 1970 who are now living in Kansas. <a href="http://www.blur.io/">More info</a></p>

    <h2>Grant</h2>
    <p>Grant is a Ruby gem and Rails plugin that forces you to make explicit security decisions about the operations performed on your ActiveRecord models. It provides a declarative way to specify rules granting permission to perform CRUD operations on ActiveRecord objects. <a href="https://github.com/nearinfinity/grant">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>Auditor</h2>
    <p>Auditor is a Rails 3 plugin for auditing access to your ActiveRecord model objects. It allows you to declaratively specify what CRUD operations should be audited and store that audit data in the database. You can also specify what attributes of model objects should automatically be audited and which ones should be ignored. <a href="https://github.com/nearinfinity/auditor">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>SSL Everywhere</h2>
    <p>SSL Everywhere is a Safari web browser extension designed to force SSL encryption for many of today's popular websites. The extension leverages code written for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation's</a>&nbsp;(EFF) <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> extension for Firefox to automatically redirect you to secure versions of many websites and rewrite insecure links to their SSL-encrypted equivalents. <a href="/products/open_source/ssl_everywhere.html">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>CSS Spriter</h2>
    <p>Improve page performance by combining image resources into a single browser request using css sprites. This tool, written in Clojure, will recursively concatenate all PNG images into a single sprite image, and generate the appropriate CSS styles to display those images correctly. CSS Spriter allows either vertical or horizontal image layouts. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites">A List Apart</a> has more information on css sprites. <a href="http://github.com/jharwig/css-spriter">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>Hbase DSL</h2>
    <p>Hbase DSL is meant to help ease the pain of writing code for Hbase. Think of it as the JDBCTemplate for Hbase, because that is what we intend for this project to be. <a href="http://github.com/nearinfinity/hbase-dsl">More Info</a></p>

    <h2>Sporm</h2>
    <p>Traditionally SharePoint projects are hard to unit test, use weak typing, and require complicated XML to query for data. Spormâ„¢ is specifically designed to simplify unit testing, enable strongly typed objects, and support LINQ access to SharePoint objects. <a href="http://sporm.codeplex.com/">More Info</a></p>
