        <h2>Blur</h2>
        <p>Blur is an open source search engine capable of querying massive amounts of data at incredible speeds. Rather than using the flat, document-like data model used by most search solutions, Blur allows you to build rich data models and search them in a relational manner similar to querying a relational database. Using Blur, you can get precise search results against terabytes or petabytes of data at Google-like speeds.</p>
