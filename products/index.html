      <p>Blur is an open source search engine capable of querying massive amounts of data at incredible speeds. Rather than using the flat, document-like data model used by most search solutions, Blur allows you to build rich data models and search them in a relational manner similar to querying a relational database. Using Blur, you can get precise search results against terabytes or petabytes of data at Google-like speeds.

      <p>Blur Console provides an administrative console for developers using Blur as well as system administrators of Blur ecosystems. It makes your job easier by providing a high-level view of the overall health of your system; details of your Zookeeper instances, controllers and shards; Blur table details; recently executed, long running and problematic user queries, and the ability to stop them; the ability to search directly against your data without going through a UI; and other administrative tools.
